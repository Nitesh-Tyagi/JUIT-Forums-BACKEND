# JUIT-Forums-BACKEND
Project - JUIT Forums , but only backend part

- src/trydjango folder is the actual project,
- src/posts folder is the app,
- the home_view HTML file (landing page and the only page) is in "src/templates" as "index.html"

This is a simple forums page with only one model and it's form. The ui is simple and pretty much self-explanatory.
Top of the page renders a form with only a text-field and a "post" button,
  followed by the posts posted on the website ordered by "-created_on" but displayed with "created_date", newest appearing above the older ones.
